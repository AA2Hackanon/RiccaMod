# RiccaMod
A Gameplay Mod for the Game "The Fairy Tale of Holy Knight Ricca: Two Winged Sisters"

Note: This mod was made for v1.3.2. Some Parts may not work for other versions.

Note that this is a ![Melonloader-Mod](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader). You need to first install Melonloader, then add this dll to the Mods folder.
Also, when installing Melonloader, Make sure to direct it to the executable in the bin foalder, *not* the launcher, or it will not work.
Also also, Melonloader fucks up the launcher when it gets installed, so you will have to manually click the game exe from then on out. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

All features can be disabled individually, and most of them can be configured in the .cfg file that gets generated next to the dll the first time the mod is started.
Adds the following Features:
## Short Hops
Tapping the Jump button for a short amoutn of time will cause you to make only a very shallow jump, allowing for easier access to aerial attacks.

## Fast Fall
Holding down while descending after a jump speeds up your fall.

## Air Dodge
Adds a Melee-Style airdodge which, just like their melee counterpart, is usefull for almost anything except actually dodging things with its 0.1ms iframes.

So if you ever wanted to wavedash in a hentai game for some reason, this is the mod for you.

Note: By default this is bound to guard + special attack. It is highly recommended to bind one of the camera-buttons to a unique key in the game settings, then open this mods .cfg file and bind it to that camera action. This way, you do not accidentally waste mana on a special attack.

## Rising Guard
Guarding is now allowed while rising from a Jump. With the Jump-Cancel perk, this allows you to immediately cancel offensive actions into a defensive option.

## Dash Attack Timing
In the original Game, Dash attacks become legal after 500ms, otherwise you do a strong attack. With this, they come out earlier, at 250ms. Value can be configured in the .cfg file that is generated on first startup.

## Combos
Light-Attack and tils can be combined, and Heavy-Attacks can turn into light attacks mid-combo (but not the other way around, didnt figure out how to do that)
